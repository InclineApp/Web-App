                    Jake is currently a senior in high school and is planning on attending The New School NYC in fall of 2017. He was approached late junior year with the opportunity to develop an app that would help improve his high school’s fitness department. The app needed to completely replace the school’s current means for entering and analyzing presidential fitness data. Initially the app idea was listed as a build challenge, meaning anyone could develop a prototype and later they would be compared.

                    Jake decided to combine efforts with his friend Thomas Maloney, another junior. After countless weeks of development and research, Incline Fitness was born and both Jake and Tom received the best project award and were allowed to further work on the project over the summer. During the following 2 months Jake worked on designing and developing the front end portion of the Incline Fitness mobile application. He worked closely with Thomas on implementation and testing, on July 17th 2016 Incline Fitness was published on the IOS marketplace for anyone to download completely free.
